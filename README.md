## P3D Clone on TRON

This is a simple copy of P3D built TRON. It allows you to buy and sell a
token that increase in price when bought and decrease in price when sold. 
It's powered by [TronWeb](https://github.com/tronprotocol/tron-web)
and integrated using [TronLink](https://github.com/TronWatch/TronLink). 
The contract is hosted at TEZRaKqCbUuZN5vnKMjWYWo7r4c92woNsC on TRON Shasta Testnet.
